# My Restaurant Management Suite

## Project Overview
This project is a custom management suite for Rod, who owns two restaurants on Padre Island:

### 1. Hardknocks Sports Bar & Grill
- Sports bar with 60+ TVs, event hosting (bingo, game nights, private events)
- Community involvement (fundraisers, donations)
- Not beach-themed, but located on Padre Island
- Known for creative event hosting (e.g., staff dress up, giant TV rentals)

### 2. Anchor Bar & Grill
- Only bar/restaurant on the actual beach in the area
- Located inside the Wyndham on Padre Island
- Features an outdoor bar on the water
- Community-focused, hosts events and fundraisers
- Unique artwork and decor (including custom host stand)

## Rod’s Vision & Needs
- Increase sales, streamline operations, improve staff communication
- Old-school approach: prefers not to upgrade POS, managers have their own systems
- No central digital hub; relies on Facebook for all business web presence
- Skeptical of traditional websites, prefers social media
- Needs a solution that is easy, central, and adds value without disrupting current habits

## Proposal Goals
- Present both a regular price and a subscription-based option (monthly management of features)
- Emphasize solving real needs: structure, communication, event management, and community engagement
- Make the proposal compelling and tailored to Rod’s style and business realities

## Next Steps

## Feature Requirements & User Roles

### 1. Centralized Scheduling
- All staff (servers, bar, kitchen) can view the full daily schedule in one place.
- Managers enter schedules their own way, but the dashboard aggregates them for everyone.
- Staff can view schedules online (no Facebook required).
- Managers and Rod can see who is working each day across all roles.

### 2. Specials Management
- Managers can reuse existing specials without approval.
- Rod can modify any special and must approve new specials before posting.
- Archive of frequently reused specials (e.g., "Wing Wednesday") for quick selection.
- Option to auto-post recurring specials on set days unless changed.

### 3. Announcements & Messaging
- Announcements section for staff and customers (closures, events, updates).
- Rod can send messages to all staff or managers.
- Managers can send messages to all staff or specific groups (bar, kitchen, FOH).
- Messaging UI allows targeting groups via checkboxes/tabs.

### 4. Events Calendar
- Public calendar of events (bingo, fundraisers, private parties) for guests and staff.
- Website can be linked from Facebook to encourage public use for updates.
- Calendar is easier to navigate than Facebook posts.
- Only managers can add or edit events.

### 5. Access & Permissions
- Rod, managers, and select kitchen staff can log in to see all dashboard features.
- Other staff must log in to see staff-only info (not public).
- Servers can post comments/talk to each other in a staff-only area.
- Only managers can make public changes (e.g., specials, announcements).
