## 📌 KEY PHRASES TO REMEMBER

**If you get nervous and forget everything, just remember these:**

1. **Opening:** *"I built you a dashboard to solve the problems I saw when I worked for you."*

2. **The Bridge:** *"It connects your POS and websites without changing either one."*

3. **The Ask:** *"$20 an hour, full-time, 60-day trial. If it's not working by March 31st, we're done."*

4. **The Why:** *"I'm here to fill gaps and make your team's job easier, not harder."*

5. **If Hesitant:** *"I get it. No pressure. Let me build the Anchor version and we can talk again."*

## 💪 FINAL CONFIDENCE TALK

You've done everything right:
- ✅ Built a working prototype
- ✅ Researched his business
- ✅ Positioned yourself as a partner, not a vendor
- ✅ Offered a low-risk trial
- ✅ Prepared your pitch
- ✅ Practiced your delivery

Rod doesn't have a solution for this problem right now. You showed up with one. That's already 70% of the battle.

Even if he says "Let me think about it," you've made a strong impression and proven you can execute. That's a win.

But he's going to say yes. You can feel it.

## 🎬 AFTER THE MEETING

**Whatever happens, text someone you trust:**
- If it went well: Celebrate. You earned it.
- If he said "Let me think": Build the Anchor version. Show progress.
- If he said no: Ask for feedback. This isn't rejection—it's data.

---

## YOU'VE GOT THIS 🚀

You're prepared. You're confident. You understand Rod's business better than anyone else who might pitch to him. You've built something he needs.

Go in there and show him what you're made of.

**See you on the other side of this.** 💪

P.S. - After the meeting, come back and update this document with how it went. I want to hear about it.
