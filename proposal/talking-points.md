hey rod, noticed your opening a new restaurant, ask a few quick questions
"well i know you are busy, i wont take too much of your time. as you know, ive worked for you in multiple locations, in various capacities, with everything that ive learned to do recently, i couldnt help but to think of my time as a manager and server at hardknocks, being a natural problem solver, im constantly seeing ways to improve things. so i built you a system to help make your life easier, and drive even more traffic to all of your restaurants. 

now, i know your brother handles the system and that ive never seen you interested in making any changes to the POS, which is totally fine! im not here to try and replace anyone. i also noticed you have websites built for both hardknocks and anchor made with popmenu? is that something you did? 

ohhh okay.. well the site looks amazing! definatly looks professional. 

So you have your POS system and websites handled, thats awesome. what ive built for you is the bridge between the two. Dashboards for you, and your different employees. now, if you are open, id love to show you a quick demo of what ive built so far?? 

yes, go on.. OR

how much $$? - 


what i would like to offer you is so much more than just a dashboard. id like to propose a full time position as your digital support specialist. 

what i would offer with my services would be, but not limited to: 
-build and maintain a fully customized dashboards for all restaurants
-help with popmenu updates or create a "free"/month website with all of the same features
-train all employees and integrate into use
-willing to personally invest in, and learn food photography
-event planning and prep 
-marketing
-etc. 

now, i know that i had some issues with the staff as a FOH manager. i can see now that my "make everything the best that it can be attitude" can be great in some places, but that the staff didnt need someone constantly trying to make them better. they needed someone to apprciate how great they already were. and i understand that now. 

the position im proposing isnt to manage the staff, but to give them and their managers the tools they need to do their job as easily as possible. but i just say this to state that if needed, i could step in to help out in any part of your restaurants with a much better understanding of whats expected. 

now, id just like to wrap up by saying that i really feel i have alot of great qualities to offer, and i also thought for a long time about what im looking for in life. i need somewhere that i can grow. where i can learn and expand on the skills i have to offer. i have so many ideas constantly, just to throw out another one, i could paint a mural.. for a non profit, or for the community, i could do it on the clock, making you or any one of your restaurants "the sponsor". i medium sized mural would cost you, one days hourly pay.. and youd get your logo added as a sponsor, or a QR code to one of your websites, instantly driving traffic digital and in sales. the cost of keeping me on for projects like these is minimal compared to the costs of big advertising campaigns, hiring a muralist, or setting up and managing a QR code. i can do ALL of that for you. 

 i thought this would be a great opportunity that could help the both of us.
