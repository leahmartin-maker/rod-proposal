# Mentor Feedback: Your Script vs. Polished Version

## What You Did RIGHT ✅

| Your Strength | Why It Works |
|---|---|
| Acknowledged Rod's existing team (brother on POS) | Shows respect, not threatening |
| Compliments his websites | Builds rapport, not critical |
| "Bridge between the two" metaphor | Clear positioning |
| Honest about your past management style | Vulnerability is powerful |
| Offered full-time + multiple value streams | Shows you're serious |
| Emphasized "filling gaps" not "replacing people" | Removes fear from the ask |
| Willing to jump in and help anywhere | Proves commitment |

**These things are GOLD. Keep them.**

## What Needs Polish 🚨

### 1. TYPOS (These hurt your credibility in a tech pitch)

**Your version:**
```
"definatly looks professional"
"apprciate how great"
"alot of great qualities"
```

**Why it matters:** Rod is considering hiring you for a tech role. Spelling errors make you look careless, even if you're not.

**Fixed version:**
```
"definitely looks professional"
"appreciate how great"
"a lot of great qualities"
```

---

### 2. RAMBLING (Your script is too long and loses focus)

**Your version:** ~500 words, 4-5 minutes

**Problem:** Rod is busy. Long pitches bore people and lose energy. You jump between ideas without clear transitions.

**Fixed version:** ~300 words, 2.5 minutes for the pitch + Q&A

**What to cut:**
- The long personal reflection mid-pitch
- The mural idea (save as bonus later)
- "I could do X, Y, and Z"—stick to the core ask

---

### 3. UNCLEAR PRICING (Confusing, then abandoned)

**Your version:**
```
"between $1200 and $4000... monthly fee... custom website instead... 
full time position as digital support specialist"
```

**Problem:** You mention 3 different price tiers, then jump to hourly. Rod gets confused about what he's actually being asked to pay.

**Fixed version:**
```
"$20 an hour, full-time. That's roughly $3,200 a month. 60-day trial."
```

**Why this works:** Single number. Easy to calculate. Trial removes risk.

---

### 4. WEAK CLOSING (Passive, not confident)

**Your version:**
```
"I thought this would be a great opportunity that could help the both of us."
```

**Problem:** "I thought" and "could" sound uncertain. You're asking for a job—be confident.

**Fixed version:**
```
"I've got a lot I want to offer—and I know I need to be in a place where I can grow. I think that's here. That's why I'm asking for this."
```

**Why this works:** Direct. Honest. Confident.

---

### 5. PERSONAL VULNERABILITY (Good, but wrong timing)

**Your version:**
```
"I know I had some issues with the staff as a FOH manager. I can see now that my 'make everything the best' attitude can be great in some places, but the staff didn't need someone constantly trying to make them better."
```

**Problem:** You put this in the MIDDLE of your pitch. Rod might remember you as a difficult manager. This should come AFTER he shows interest (if he asks about it).

**Fixed version:** Move this to "The Why" section (PART 5 of the script), AFTER you've made your ask. Frame it positively:

```
"I know what I did wrong before as a manager—I was always pushing for 'better.' I've learned that staff don't need someone constantly trying to improve them. They need someone to appreciate what they already do well and give them better tools. That's this position."
```

**Why this works:** 
- Acknowledges the past
- Shows you've grown (maturity)
- Connects it to the NEW role
- Frames it as learning, not failure

---

### 6. MURAL IDEA (Creative, but dilutes the message)

**Your version:**
```
"I could paint a mural... for a non-profit... one day's pay... get your logo as a sponsor... instantly drive traffic."
```

**Problem:** It's a great idea, but mentioning it in the PITCH weakens your main ask. Rod might focus on the mural instead of the dashboard position.

**Better approach:**
- Say it during Q&A if he asks about "other ideas"
- Or say it at the END: *"And by the way, I'm also thinking about doing community projects like murals that feature your sponsorship—but let's get the core dashboard rolling first."*

---

### 7. FLOW & TRANSITIONS (Jumps around, hard to follow)

**Your version:**
```
"...so I built you a system...
now, i know your brother handles the system...
ohhh okay.. well the site looks amazing...
So you have your POS system and websites handled...
yes, go on.. OR how much $$?..."
```

**Problem:** You're writing dialogue like you're rehearsing both sides. It's confusing. Rod doesn't know when you're talking to him vs. imagining his response.

**Fixed version:** Write it as YOUR part only:

```
Opening → Bridge → Demo → Ask → Why → Close
```

Rod speaks when he actually speaks. You don't write his lines.

## SIDE-BY-SIDE: KEY MOMENT

### Your Version (The Ask)
```
"what i would like to offer you is so much more than just a dashboard. 
id like to propose a full time position as your digital support specialist. 

what i would offer with my services would be, but not limited to: 
-build and maintain a fully customized dashboards for all restaurants
-help with popmenu updates or create a "free"/month website
-train all employees and integrate into use
-willing to personally invest in, and learn food photography
-event planning and prep 
-marketing
-etc."
```

**Issues:**
- Starts with "so much more" (hype, not concrete)
- Title: "digital support specialist" (sounds generic)
- Bullet list (looks like a resume, not a conversation)
- "etc." (shows you haven't thought it through)
- Still no price mentioned

---

### Polished Version (The Ask)
```
"Here's what I'm proposing: Hire me full-time as your Digital Operations 
Manager at $20 an hour. I'll finish this dashboard, train your team, help 
with food photography, event planning—basically, fill the operational gaps 
so you can focus on growth. No long-term contract. Let's try it for 60 days. 
If you don't see value by March 31st, we're done. But I think you will."
```

**Why this is better:**
- Clear title (sounds like a real position)
- Clear price (removes ambiguity)
- Clear scope (concrete examples, not bullet points)
- Clear trial offer (removes risk for Rod)
- Clear confidence (you believe in it)

## WHAT TO KEEP FROM YOUR SCRIPT

✅ Your authentic relationship with Rod
✅ Respect for his brother and existing team
✅ The "bridge" positioning
✅ The honesty about your past
✅ Your willingness to do anything needed
✅ The fact that you understand his business

These are the things that make YOUR pitch special. Don't lose them trying to sound corporate.
