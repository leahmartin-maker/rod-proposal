# Why Hire a Restaurant Success Manager?

- Not just a tech or marketing person—understands your business from the inside out
- Handles staff tools, website fixes, food photography, and event planning
- Fills the gaps between your current team and your business goals
- Works with your existing people, not against them
- Flexible: can jump in to serve, bartend, or manage in a pinch
- $20/hour, full-time, with a 60-day trial—no risk
