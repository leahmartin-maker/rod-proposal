# Your Pitch Script – YOUR AUTHENTIC VERSION


## THE OPENING

"Well, I know you're busy, I won't take too much of your time. As you know, I've worked for you in multiple locations, in various capacities. With everything that I've learned to do recently, I couldn't help but think of my time as a manager and server at HardKnocks. Being a natural problem solver, I'm constantly seeing ways to improve things. So I built you a system to help make your life easier and drive even more traffic to all of your restaurants."

## SHOW RESPECT FOR WHAT HE HAS

"I know your brother handles the system and that I've never seen you interested in making any changes to the POS, which is totally fine! I'm not here to try and replace anyone. I also noticed you have websites built for both HardKnocks and Anchor made with Popmenu. Is that something you did?"

*[He'll respond]*

"Well, the site looks amazing! Definitely looks professional. So you have your POS system and websites handled—that's awesome."

## THE BRIDGE

"What I've built for you is the bridge between the two. Dashboards for you and your different employees. Now, if you are open, I'd love to show you a quick demo of what I've built so far?"

## AFTER THE DEMO: THE PROPOSAL

"What I would like to offer you is so much more than just a dashboard. I'd like to propose a position as your Digital Support Specialist.

What I would offer with my services would be, but not limited to:
- Build and maintain fully customized dashboards for all restaurants
- Help with Popmenu updates or create a website with all the same features
- Train all employees and integrate them into using it
- Personally invest in learning food photography
- Event planning and prep
- Marketing support
- Whatever else you need


I'm asking for $20 an hour, and if you do not see any need for me after 60 days, no hard feelings. 
or if you enjoy the dashboards but dont see much other need for me, we could discuss a separte payment option for creating and maintaining that tool.
